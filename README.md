# Digital Verification
</br>
**Project Introduction**
</br>
This project provides a robust digital verification system designed for organizations to issue and validate certificates to external entities. It addresses the critical need for trust and integrity by enabling external organizations to independently verify the authenticity of a certificate and detect any attempts at tampering. This ensures that the issued credentials remain secure and untampered, maintaining their validity and reliability.
